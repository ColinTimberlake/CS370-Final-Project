# CS370-Final-Project
  For This Project, I was given most of the code. There is a small section that we were tasked with. This small section was responsible for the development of Deep-Q learning.
  I made all the code for the AI section. It was a hard time figuring it all out, but I was able to do so after a lot of trial and error. I made the code to run for the project
  so that the AI would learn how to play and then how to win the game of pirate treasure hunt. 

  Computer scientists are problem solvers. They come up with solutions to people's problems that they are hired for. They also fix problems as they arise in their solutions
  when it has been deployed to the customer. It matters because it can help to make the world a better place. There is also the simple fact that it will allow them to improve
  people's lives with each step along the way. There are always better solutions to any problem that people have already solved before.

  The best way to approach a problem for me is to first read it and make sure I understand each part of it. Then my next step is to figure out if I have done a problem like 
  this or like this. If I have then I will go back and look at what I did there and make changes as needed. Then from there I get to work, and I start making the structure 
  of the program and give a basic outline. Then I flesh out the program and make changes as needed.

  My ethical responsibilities to the user and the organization are very different. I feel that for the user I need to supply the best experience for them. I need to create
  the best and least cluttered option for them to view it. I also need to build something that is complete and fills all their needs and their wants. For the organization, 
  I need to create the most cost effective and logical solution. I need to be able to make the most logical and top to bottom structure and flow. I need to fill the user's 
  needs first and wants if there is time. I need to deliver on time and as effectively as possible for the user and company.
